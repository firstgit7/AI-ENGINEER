## Common Week 1 Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: "Python feels overwhelming"
**Solution**: Focus on basics first. Don't try to learn everything at once.

**Challenge**: "Math is too difficult"
**Solution**: Use Khan Academy for review. Math will make sense with practice.

**Challenge**: "Can't find time to study"
**Solution**: Start with 30 minutes daily. Consistency beats intensity.

**Challenge**: "Too many resources, don't know which to follow"
**Solution**: Stick to the recommended path. Avoid tutorial paralysis.

## Week 1 Project: Simple Data Analysis
**Goal**: Analyze a small dataset using Python and Pandas

**Steps**:
