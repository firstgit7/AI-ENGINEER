   - **Fix:** ATS-friendly format, quantified achievements

2. **Online Assessment (40% rejection):**
   - **Issue:** Unable to solve problems in time
   - **Fix:** More LeetCode practice, time management

3. **Technical Interviews (50% rejection):**
   - **Issue:** Can't explain thought process
   - **Fix:** Practice explaining solutions out loud

4. **Behavioral Interviews (20% rejection):**
   - **Issue:** Poor culture fit, unclear stories
   - **Fix:** STAR method, genuine examples

### **Competitive Programming Impact**

**Codeforces Rating for FAANG:**
- **No rating needed:** Can get job without CP background
- **1200-1400 (Blue):** Shows solid DSA skills
- **1400+ (Purple):** Significantly helps in referrals
- **1900+ (Orange/Red):** Can lead to direct recruitment

**Reality Check:**
- LeetCode is more interview-relevant than Codeforces
- But CP builds problem-solving speed
- Many Google/Meta engineers mention good CP rating in referral requests
